'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Solution: 906609 = 913*933

# Add the multiply value of the two 3-digit numbers to the pali_num dictionary
# when the value is a 6 digital number and it meets the definition of a palindromic number
